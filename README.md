# Code as Data. Developer similarity

# Project objectives
- Learn the basics of working with code as data
- Study the process of working with —Å git/GitHub API/programming languages classifier/code as AST
- Apply the knowlege in pratice to implement "Developer similarity" project  

# Steps of work
- Use git to extract useful information
    - Collect data from commits in public github repositories
    - Aggregate data by specific author name/email
- Extract information from source code
    - Classify programming languages using [enry](https://github.com/go-enry/go-enry)
    - Extract AST from code using [tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter)
- Summarize data to create project
    - Prepare data
    - Create model
    - Choose quality metrics
    - Write tests
    - Configure CI
    - Build docker image
